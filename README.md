# Elektron B2B Mobile – Frontend (React Native)

This repository contains the mobile frontend part of the B2B eCommerce solution developed for Elektron.

The code was written using React Native and represents **a work-in-progress**, not a final production version.

📌 **Note:** This repository only includes my personal contribution to the project, and is intended to serve as a record of my development work for professional purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository was created to **showcase my personal work** within the Elektron B2B Mobile project.  
It serves as a **portfolio piece**, allowing me to share and document my contributions using modern tools like React Native.

During my time on the project, I was responsible for:
- Setting up the base structure of the mobile app using React Native and Expo
- Implementing navigation with React Navigation
- Creating and styling views and components
- Connecting the app to backend services using the Fetch API
- Managing component-level state and handling user interaction

> Due to professional considerations, only my part of the project is included.

Its purpose is to showcase the code structure and my development work within the mobile frontend.
